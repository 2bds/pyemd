**Important**
This is an experimental module. Please use it with care as no guarantee can be
given for obtaining reasonable results, or that they will be computed index
the most computation optimal way.

**BEMD** performed on bidimensional data such as images.
This procedure uses morphological operators to detect regional maxima
which are then used to span surface envelope with a radial basis function.
