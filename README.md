# PyEMD
Yet another implementation of EMD in Python. Had this in my private collection for a while and it seems now, before I wipe it completely, is the time to share it.

Don't hesitate to contact me with any questions/suggestions.

Enjoy it!

# Under refurbishment
Coming soon, better, shinier and with documentation!
